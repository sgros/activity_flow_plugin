    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly Net Monitor?</string>
    <string name="help_whatis_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor monitors
        network traffic from installed apps. It scans active network connections with a background
        service and also displays additional network encryption information.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_one">How does connection monitoring work?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one_answer">Net Monitor deploys an background service, which scans for
        active connections every second. Apps invoking the detected connections are identified and
        listed with remote addresses they are communicating with.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_two">What is protocol and encryption detection?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Based on a connection\'s remote port, the transport protocol
        can be identified by "Well Known Port" tables. Based on the known ports, a warning is given
        in case a connection is known for not being encrypted. Note, that this is no grantee
        that the connection uses this protocol, since assignment of port numbers is not enforced by the system.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_three">What is hostname resolution?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_answer">The remote host name assigned is requested by
        reverse name resolution. This is done asynchronously in background and thus may take some seconds.
        Remark: The resolved hostname may not be the actual domain name requested by e.g. a browser app.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_four">What are detailed reports?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">A detailed mode can be switched on in the settings.
        After activation additional technical information of scanned connections is displayed after a
        connection has been touched in the overview.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_five">What is certificate validation?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">An automatic analysis of the remote servers TLS
        implementation can be activated in the settings. When active, remote servers with a resolved
        hostname are tested automatically when the connection protocol is known for using TLS
        encryption. The analysis is performed by SSL Labs API and the associated service. The remote
        server\'s implementation quality is shown in grades A+ (best) to F (worst), or is displayed
        as T (trust issues). For further information on SSL Lab API see the About.</string>

    <string name="help_privacy">What makes the app privacy-friendly?</string>
    <string name="help_privacy_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor does not include any tracking mechanisms
        or advertisement and comes free of charge. It is published under
        GPLv3 license and is free to distribute. The information on network connections is not stored.</string>

    <string name="help_permission">Which permissions requires the app?</string>
    <string name="help_permission_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor does not require any permission
        for scanning active connections. The Certificate Validation feature requires
        the Internet permission to request server test results from Qualys SSL Labs.</string>

    <string name="help_sysuser">What does the [System] tag mean?</string>
    <string name="help_sysuser_answer">The [System] tag identifies an app pre-installed on the
        android system by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). If the app is named \'System
        [System]\', an android system component itself has invoked the connection (root-user).</string>

    <string name="help_ssllabs">What is SSL-Labs</string>
    <string name="help_ssllabs_answer">SSL-Labs API from Qualys performs a deep analysis of SSL/TLS
        web server. Net Monitor requests analysis results on demand from SSL Labs. SSL-Labs privacy
    terms state, that it does not share submitted IP addresses or hostnames with any third party. </string>

    <string name="help_un_encrypted_ports">What are the meanings of unencrypted and encrypted ports in the detail view?</string>
    <string name="help_un_encrypted_ports_answer">In fact the ports are not unencrypted or encrypted.
    But a port is handling all the traffic of one service. This services communicates over a
    unencrypted or encrypted protocol. If an "port is encrypted" it means that the service, that communicates
    over this port, is using an encrypted protocol (vise versa for unencrypted).</string>
